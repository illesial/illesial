- 👋 Hi, I’m Osman @illesial.
- 👀 I’m an Applied Mathematician Data Scientist. Check out my website at https://illesial.github.io.
- 🌱 I’m currently playing around with [Julia](julialang.org)'s [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) Deep Learning library and various excellent [Differential Equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/) tools.
- 🗳️🔧 If you're interested in NYC + NYS Elections Data, you mind find my [Election Tools](https://github.com/illesial/election-tools) helpful with matching data from various sources.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting Machine Learning projects in Julia or Python, especially scientific applications where its possible to explore a blending of mechanicstic / non-mechanistic tools such as Neural ODEs (see [DiffEqFlux](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl)).
- 📫 Email me - see the link at the bottom of my [website](https://illesial.github.io).
